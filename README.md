Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design patterns

Design Patterns Overview
Design patterns provide standard solutions to recurring software design challenges. They are grouped into three main categories:

Behavioral Patterns:

Observer Pattern: Notifies multiple observers automatically when the subject's state changes.
Strategy Pattern: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms, allowing dynamic selection at runtime.
Creational Patterns:

Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation to manage it more effectively.
Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance globally.
Structural Patterns:

Adapter Pattern: Converts one interface into another, enabling compatibility between systems.
Decorator Pattern: Dynamically adds behavior to objects without altering their underlying structure.
These patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design challenges like object creation, organization, and behavior control.

Exercise 2: 8. Virtual Classroom Manager Programming Exercise

The Virtual Classroom Manager allows users to manage virtual classrooms, enroll students, and handle assignment scheduling and submissions via terminal commands. Users can:

Add classrooms, enroll students, and schedule assignments.
Submit assignments for specific classrooms.
Console output confirms each action (e.g., "Classroom [Name] has been created", "Assignment submitted by Student [ID] in [Class Name]").
